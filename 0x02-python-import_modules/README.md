# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Import Modules

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating the use of importing modules and working with variables.

## Task 0 - 0-add.py

Create a Python script `0-add.py` that imports the `add` function from the `add_0` module and performs a simple addition. The script should print the result.

## Task 1 - 1-calculation.py

Develop a Python script `1-calculation.py` that imports various arithmetic functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) from the `calculator_1` module and performs these operations on given values. The results should be printed.

## Task 2 - 2-args.py

Write a Python script `2-args.py` that takes command-line arguments, counts the number of arguments, and prints each argument along with its position.

## Task 3 - 3-infinite_add.py

Create a Python script `3-infinite_add.py` that takes any number of command-line arguments and prints their sum.

## Task 4 - 4-hidden_discovery.py

Develop a Python script `4-hidden_discovery.py` that imports a module named `hidden_4` and prints all names defined in the module, excluding those starting with "__".

## Task 5 - 5-variable_load.py

Write a Python script `5-variable_load.py` that imports a variable named `a` from the `variable_load_5` module and prints its value.

Make sure to follow the provided requirements and guidelines for writing these scripts.
